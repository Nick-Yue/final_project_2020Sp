Title: Analysis of the relationship between consumption of various fuel resources and climate change in the US.

When uploaded on the Github, the Jupyter notebook lost its feature of interactivity and some of my dynamic plots may not be shown unless being downloaded to local computers. Hence, I created a mybinder page to solve this problem, please check here:

Description:

United States Government reports on consumption, production, expenditures, and prices of various fuel sources. Basic climate factors are also reported by National Centers for Environmental Information. This project will analyze how the consumption of different types of fuel resources influences the climate in the US with a time span of 30 years (1984-2014).


Hypothesis 1: The growth of the consumption of fuel resources is positively corelated with the warmth of the nationwide climate which can be reflected by multiple factors.

Hypothesis 2: Different purposes ( commercial, industrial, residential) of fuel consumptions contribute to the climate change in different degrees.
